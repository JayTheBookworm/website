<h1>Impact</h1>

<h4><i>"The crater rises high above the desert around it, the only thing of note in sight. From the outside, one can see around the top of the perimiter, watchtowers look out over the desert, using the massive crater as a wall. A portion of the meteor peeks out from behind the crater wall, it's glittering black surface reflecting the unrelenting desert sun. As you aproach the gate built from a cut in the crater, a sense of unease that has been with you since you first saw this place grows to a crescendo. 
        Something is very wrong here."</i></h4>
<h2>The Locale</h2>
<p>The town of Impact is centered around The Meteor, and it's main purpose is to extract resources from it. The Silver Sword Trading Company controls Impact as a result of their control over food and supply shipments and their truce with the Bedine that keeps Impact relatively safe from outside threats. More directly, the day to day municipal descisions of Impact are made by Mayor Blekman (see Reinout Blekman) but in the end he too serves as a puppet of the SSTC.</p>
<p>A few distinct factions exist within the settlement. The most powerful of these is, of course, those in the service of the SSTC, followed by the researchers and craftspeople who hold sway with both the SSTC and the workers of Impact who rest at the bottom of the social power ladder.</p>
